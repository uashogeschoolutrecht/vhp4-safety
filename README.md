# Virtual Human Platform for Safety (VHP4S) - Quick Test Guide

This project is part of the **Virtual Human Platform for Safety (VHP4S)**, which involves integrating medical data, creating graph-based knowledge management systems, and using advanced tools like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for disease-specific information retrieval. The primary focus is on three case studies: Parkinson's disease, kidney disease, and thyroid disorders.

## Libraries

This project makes use of two primary Python libraries:
1. **biochatter==0.7.5**: A tool for generating biomedical-related text and integrating natural language generation with biomedical ontologies.
2. **biocypher==0.5.44**: A library for creating and managing biomedical graphs in Neo4j and integrating data from multiple sources for building knowledge networks.

## Prerequisites

To use this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Neo4j (if using graph database functionalities)
- pip (Python package manager)

# Quick Test
## Here's how to do a quick test of the setup:

### Biochatter Quick Test
You can generate biomedical text or interact with biomedical knowledge using biochatter. Here's a simple test to get you started:

```python
from biochatter import BioChatter

Initialize BioChatter
chatter = BioChatter()

Test generating a summary for Parkinson's disease
disease_summary = chatter.summarize_disease('Parkinson\'s disease')
print(disease_summary)
```

### Run the above script, and you should see a summary generated by BioChatter for Parkinson's disease.

### Biocypher Quick Test
To test biocypher, we will generate a simple graph structure in memory:

```python
from biocypher import BioCypher
# Initialize the BioCypher graph
bc = BioCypher()

# Add a node and relationship to the graph
bc.add_node('Patient_001', 'Person', {'age': 65, 'disease': 'Parkinson\'s disease'})
bc.add_node('Disease_001', 'Disease', {'name': 'Parkinson\'s disease'})
bc.add_relationship('Patient_001', 'Disease_001', 'has_disease')

# Export the graph in a Neo4j-compatible format
graph_data = bc.export()

print(graph_data)
```

This will generate a simple graph structure that represents a patient with Parkinson's disease, along with their relationship to the disease. The output will be in a format that can be imported into Neo4j if desired.
